# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. It's built using modern, framework-less web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually appealing. It also includes a simple partnership inquiry form using Formspree.

## Style, Design, and Features

*   **Player Choices:** Buttons for the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, now represented by emojis.
*   **Computer AI:** The computer will randomly choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
*   **Result Display:** The game will show the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the round (win, lose, or draw).
*   **Score Keeping:** The game will keep track of the player's score and the computer's score.
*   **Winning Effect:** A visual animation is displayed when the player wins a round.
*   **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between dark and light themes, and their preference is saved.
*   **Partnership Inquiry Form:** A simple form to allow users to send partnership inquiries, integrated with Formspree for backend handling.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Integrate a "Partnership Inquiry" form using Formspree.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Modify `index.html`:** Add the HTML structure for the partnership inquiry form, including input fields for name, email, and message, and a submit button.
    2.  **Modify `style.css`:** Add styling to make the form visually consistent with the rest of the application.
    3.  **Formspree Integration:** Set up the form to send data to Formspree, requiring the user to obtain their unique Formspree ID.
