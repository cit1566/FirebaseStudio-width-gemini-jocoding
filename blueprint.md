# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. It's built using modern, framework-less web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be simple, intuitive, and visually appealing.

## Style, Design, and Features

*   **Player Choices:** Buttons for the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
*   **Computer AI:** The computer will randomly choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
*   **Result Display:** The game will show the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of the round (win, lose, or draw).
*   **Score Keeping:** The game will keep track of the player's score and the computer's score.
*   **Reset Button:** Allows players to start a new game at any time.

## Current Plan

*   **Objective:** Create a fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Modify `index.html`:** Create the basic structure of the game, including player choice buttons, areas to display player and computer choices, the result, and the score.
    2.  **Modify `style.css`:** Style the game elements for a clean and intuitive interface.
    3.  **Modify `main.js`:** Implement the game logic, including handling player choices, generating the computer's choice, determining the winner, updating the score, and the reset functionality.
